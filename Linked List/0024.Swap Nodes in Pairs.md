## LC 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs

Description: Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

Example: 

Input: head = [1,2,3,4]

Output: [2,1,4,3]

```python

class Solution(object):
    def swapPairs(self, head):
        dummy_head = ListNode(next = head)
        curr = dummy_head
        while curr.next and curr.next.next:
            temp = curr.next
            temp1 = curr.next.next.next
            curr.next = curr.next.next
            curr.next.next = temp
            curr.next.next.next = temp1
            curr = curr.next.next
        return dummy_head.next
