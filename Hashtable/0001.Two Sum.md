# LC 1. Two Sum
Description: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

Ans:
```python
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        records = dict()

        for index, value in enumerate(nums):  
            # 遍历当前元素，并在map中寻找是否有匹配的key
            if target - value in records:   
                return [records[target- value], index]
            # 遍历当前元素，并添加到dict里
            records[value] = index    
        print(records)
        # dont find the pair
        return []
```
