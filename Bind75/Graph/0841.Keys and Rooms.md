# 841. Keys and Rooms

## Description
There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and all the rooms are locked except for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.

When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.

Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room i, return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false otherwise.

## Example 1:
```
Input: rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]
Output: true
Explanation: 
We visit room 0 and pick up key 1.
We then visit room 1 and pick up key 2.
We then visit room 2 and pick up key 3.
We then visit room 3.
Since we were able to visit every room, we return true.

```

## Example 2:
```
Input: rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
Output: false
Explanation: We can not enter room number 2 since the only key that unlocks it is in that room.
```

## Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        visited = set()
        dic = {}
        stack = []

        # create dic or adj list
        for i in range(len(rooms)):
            dic[i] = rooms[i]
            
        # update stack since room 0 is always allowed
        for i in dic[0]:
            stack.append(i)

        # update the room number to visited
        visited.add(0)
        
        # while stack is not empty
        while len(stack) > 0:
            curr = stack.pop()
            visited.add(curr)
            for i in dic[curr]:
                if i not in visited:
                    stack.append(i)
        return len(dic) == len(visited)
```
