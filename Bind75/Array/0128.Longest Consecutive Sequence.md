# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

## Description
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
```

## Solution:

```py
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        numSet = set(nums)
        longest = 0
        for n in nums:
            # check if its the start of a sequence. If yes, then its start with a sequence
            # 只check开头
            if (n - 1) not in numSet:
                length = 0
                # loop这个sequence的长度
                while (n + length) in numSet:
                    length += 1
                longest = max(length, longest)
        return longest
