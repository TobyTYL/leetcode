# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array\

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

* [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
* [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.

Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

# Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```

# Example 2:
    
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```

## Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        hi, lo = len(nums) - 1, 0
        while hi  > lo:
            mid = (hi + lo)//2
            if nums[lo] > nums[mid]: 
                hi = mid
            else: # drop must be to the left
                lo = mid
        if nums[hi] > nums[lo]:
            return nums[0]
        return nums[hi]
```
