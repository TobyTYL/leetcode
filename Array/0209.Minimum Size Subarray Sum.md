## LC 209 Minimum Size Subarray Sum

Description: Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target, return the minimal length of a __subarray__ whose sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.

### Ideal: Sliding window

~~Brutal force: Two for loop, keep looking for subsequences that meet the conditions. __Time complexity__: O(n^2)~~

Sliding window: Continuously adjust the start and end positions of the subsequence to get the result we want.

* What's in the window?
* How to move the start position? (first pointer)
* How to move the end position? (second pointer)

##### How to move the window?

The window is the smallest continuous subarray of length that satisfies the its total sum greater than or equal s (sum >= s)

Start position: If the sum of the window greater than s, then the start pointer need to move forward

End position: Keep travesal the array

__Time Complexity:__ O(n)

__Space Complexity:__ O(1)


```Python
class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        start = 0
        pointer = 0
        size = len(nums)
        sum_v = 0
        result = float("inf")
        for pointer in range(size):
            sum_v += nums[pointer]
            while sum_v >= target:
                result = min(result, pointer-start+1)
                sum_v -= nums[start]
                start += 1
        if result == float("inf"):
            return 0 
        else:
            return result
