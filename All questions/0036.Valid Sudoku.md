# LC 36. Valid Sudoku

## Description
Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

### Example 1:

## Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def isValidSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        # 1. check Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
        cols = collections.defaultdict(set)
        rows = collections.defaultdict(set)
        # key = (r / 3, c / 3)
        squares = collections.defaultdict(set) 
        for r in range(9):
            for c in range(9):
                # if empty space
                if board[r][c] == ".":
                    continue
                # 2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
                if (board[r][c] in rows[r] or
                    board[r][c] in cols[c] or 
                    board[r][c] in squares[(r//3, c//3)]):
                    return False
                cols[c].add(board[r][c])
                rows[r].add(board[r][c])
                 # 3. Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
                squares[(r//3, c//3)].add(board[r][c])
        return True
