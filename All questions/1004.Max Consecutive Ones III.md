# 1004 Max Consecutive Ones III

## 次数：1

## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

## Solution:

```py
class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, A: List[int], K: int) -> int:
      left = right = 0
      
      for right in range(len(A)):
        # if we encounter a 0 the we decrement K
        if A[right] == 0:
          K -= 1
        # else no impact to K
        
        # if K < 0 then we need to move the left part of the window forward
        # to try and remove the extra 0's
        if K < 0:
          # if the left one was zero then we adjust K
          if A[left] == 0:
            K += 1
          # regardless of whether we had a 1 or a 0 we can move left side by 1
          # if we keep seeing 1's the window still keeps moving as-is
          left += 1
      
      return right - left + 1
