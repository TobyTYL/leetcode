# LC 503. Next Greater Element II

## Description
Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), return the next greater number for every element in nums.

The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this number.

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number. 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,3]
Output: [2,3,4,-1,4]
```

## 思路
* 要求在一个循环数组中找到每个元素的下一个更大元素，这意味着在查找下一个更大元素时，数组可以被看作连接在一起的，即遍历数组两次。


## Solution:

```py
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElements(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        stack = []
        size = len(nums)
        res = [-1] * size 
        
        for _ in range(2):
            for i in range(size):
                while stack and nums[stack[-1]] < nums[i]:
                    res[stack[-1]] = nums[i]
                    stack.pop()
                stack.append(i)
        return res
```
