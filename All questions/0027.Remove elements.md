## LC 27: Remove element
## Description:
Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

* Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.

* Return k.


target 为2
[2,2,3,3] -> [3,3, _, _] -> [3,3]

## Example:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

## Idea: 
* 双指针，慢的从0开始，当快指针指向的位置的值等于target时候。慢指针指向的地方的值 = 快指针指的地方的值。（覆盖而不是删除）
* 最终快指针会会指向空，所以将后几个元素删除了。[3,3, _, _]

class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        slow = 0
        fast = 0
        size = len(nums)
        while fast < size:
            if nums[fast] != val:
                nums[slow] = nums[fast]
                slow += 1
            fast += 1
        return slow
```
