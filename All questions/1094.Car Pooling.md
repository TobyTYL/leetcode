# LC 1094. Car Pooling

## Description
There is a car with capacity empty seats. The vehicle only drives east (i.e., it cannot turn around and drive west).

You are given the integer capacity and an array trips where trips[i] = [numPassengersi, fromi, toi] indicates that the ith trip has numPassengersi passengers and the locations to pick them up and drop them off are fromi and toi respectively. The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from the car's initial location.

Return true if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips, or false otherwise.

__Example 1:__

```
Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 4
Output: false
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 5
Output: true
```

__Constraints:__

* 1 <= trips.length <= 1000
* trips[i].length == 3
* 1 <= numPassengersi <= 100
* 0 <= fromi < toi <= 1000
* 1 <= capacity <= 100000

## Solution:

```py
class Solution:
    def carPooling(self, trips: List[List[int]], capacity: int) -> bool:
        nums = [0] * 1001
        # 构造差分解法
        df = self.Difference(nums)
        for trip in trips:
            val = trip[0]
            start = trip[1]
            end = trip[2]
            df.add(start, end, val)
        res = df.result()
        for i in res:
            if i > capacity:
                return False
        return True
        
    class Difference:
        def __init__(self, nums):
            self.nums = nums
            self.diff = [0] * (len(nums) + 1)

        def add(self, start, end, val):
            self.diff[start] += val
            self.diff[end] -= val

        def result(self):
            res = [0] * len(self.diff)
            res[0] = self.diff[0]
            for i in range(1, len(self.diff)):
                res[i] = res[i - 1] + self.diff[i]

            return res
```
