## LC 541. Reverse String II

Description: 

Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.

Example:
```
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
```

### __Ideal: 每次循环加2k，反转某一段列表方法：s[p:p2][::-1]__


Ans:
```py
class Solution(object):
    def reverseStr(self, s, k):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type k: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        p = 0
        while p < len(s):
            p2 = p + k
            # Written in this could be more pythonic.
            s = s[:p] + s[p: p2][::-1] + s[p2:]
            p = p + 2 * k
        return s
```
