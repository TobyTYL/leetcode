# LC 958. Check Completeness of a Binary Tree

## Description
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

In a complete binary tree, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.


### Example 1:

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: true
```
Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.

## Solution:
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:

    def isCompleteTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        from collections import deque
        q = deque([root])
        end = False
        while q:
            size = len(q)
            for _ in range(size):
                node = q.popleft()
                if node is None:
                    end = True
                else:
                    if end:
                        return False
                    q.append(node.left)
                    q.append(node.right)
        return True
```
