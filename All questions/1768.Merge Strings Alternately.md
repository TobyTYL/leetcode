# 1768. Merge Strings Alternately

## Description:

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

Example 1:

```
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
```

## Solution:

```py
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        result = []
        for i in range(min(len(word1),len(word2))):
            result.append(word1[i] + word2[i])
            
        return ''.join(result) + word1[i+1:] + word2[i+1:]
```
