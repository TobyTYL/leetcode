# 1679. Max Number of K-Sum Pairs

## Description:
You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals k and remove them from the array.

Return the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array.

* 需要找出数组中有多少对不同的元素可以加起来等于 k，同时确保每个元素最多只被用一次。


## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:
- Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
- Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []
There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.
```

## Solution:

```py
class Solution:
    def maxOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        
```
