# LC 438. Find All Anagrams in a String

## Description
Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

__Example 1:__

```
Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0,6]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```

```py
class Solution:
    def findAnagrams(self, s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:
        from collections import defaultdict
        need, window = defaultdict(int), defaultdict(int)
        for i in p:
            need[i] += 1
        left, right = 0, 0
        valid = 0
        ans = []

        while right < len(s):
            c = s[right]
            right += 1
            if c in need:
                window[c] += 1
                if window[c] == need[c]:
                    valid += 1
            while right - left >= len(p):
                # 当窗口符合条件时，把起始索引加入 res
                if valid == len(need):
                    ans.append(left)
                d = s[left] 
                left += 1
                if d in need:
                    if window[d] == need[d]:
                        valid -= 1
                    window[d] -= 1
                    
        return ans
