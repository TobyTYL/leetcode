# LC 1122. Relative Sort Array

## Description
Given two arrays arr1 and arr2, the elements of arr2 are distinct, and all elements in arr2 are also in arr1.

Sort the elements of arr1 such that the relative ordering of items in arr1 are the same as in arr2. Elements that don't appear in arr2 should be placed at the end of arr1 in ascending order.

## Example 1:
```
Input: arr1 = [2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19], arr2 = [2,1,4,3,9,6]
Output: [2,2,2,1,4,3,3,9,6,7,19]
```

## 思路
* 用哈希表来记录每个元素的出现次数
* 遍历 arr2，将 arr1 中的元素按照 arr2 的顺序添加到结果数组中


## Solution:
```py
class Solution:
    def relativeSortArray(self, arr1: List[int], arr2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        remaining = []
        n = len(arr1)
        for i in arr1:
            if i not in arr2:
                remaining.append(i)
        dup = [0] * (len(arr1) - len(remaining))
        count = {}
        for num in arr1:
            if num in count:
                count[num] += 1
            else:
                count[num] = 1
        index = 0
        for i in range(n - len(remaining)):
            cur_freq = count[arr2[index]]
            if cur_freq == 0:
                index += 1
                
            dup[i] = arr2[index]
            count[arr2[index]] -= 1
        dup.extend(sorted(remaining))
        return dup
```
