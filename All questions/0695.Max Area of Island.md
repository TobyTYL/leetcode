# 695. Max Area of Island

## Description

You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

```
Input: grid = 
[
[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
]

Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

## Solution: 

```py
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0

    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # 与200.独立岛屿不同的是：此题grid列表内是int！！！

        # BFS
        if not grid: return 0

        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        visited = [[False for i in range(n)] for j in range(m)]

        result = 0
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if not visited[i][j] and grid[i][j] == 1:
                    # 每一个新岛屿
                    self.count = 0
                    self.bfs(grid, visited, i, j)
                    result = max(result, self.count)

        return result

    def bfs(self, grid, visited, i, j):
        self.count += 1
        visited[i][j] = True    

        queue = collections.deque([(i, j)])
        while queue:
            x, y = queue.popleft()
            for new_x, new_y in [(x + 1, y), (x - 1, y), (x, y - 1), (x, y + 1)]:
                if 0 <= new_x < len(grid) and 0 <= new_y < len(grid[0]) and not visited[new_x][new_y] and grid[new_x][new_y] == 1:
                    visited[new_x][new_y] = True
                    self.count += 1
                    queue.append((new_x, new_y))
