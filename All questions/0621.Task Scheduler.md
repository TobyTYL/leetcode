# LC 621. Task Scheduler

## Description
You are given an array of CPU tasks, each labeled with a letter from A to Z, and a number n. Each CPU interval can be idle or allow the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: there has to be a gap of at least n intervals between two tasks with the same label.

Return the minimum number of CPU intervals required to complete all tasks.

## Examples

```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B
```
## 思路：
1. 首先统计每个任务的频率，找出频率最高的任务
2. 计算最小时间，最小时间为 (max_count - 1) * (n + 1) + max_count_tasks
3. 最小时间可能小于任务总数，返回最大值

## Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        task_counts = Counter(tasks)
        # 找出最大频率的tasks
        max_count = max(task_counts.values())
        max_count_tasks = sum(1 for count in task_counts.values() if count == max_count)
        
        part_count = max_count - 1
        part_length = n + 1
        empty_slots = part_count * part_length
        total_length = empty_slots + max_count_tasks
        
        return max(total_length, len(tasks))
```
