## LC 977: Squares of a Sorted Array
Description: Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Ideal: 
* Since this is a non-decreasing array, the beginning and the end will be the greast value whole array. 

* So first step is to find the biggest value
* And we repeat this process again til two pointer touch together
* nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10] -> [16,1,0,9,100] -> [0,1,9,16,100]

Brute force: square each of the element in the array, and sort the whole array

__Time complexity__: O(n + nlogn) or O(nlogn) depends on the sort algorithm. 

If we are using two pointer to deal with it, it may be __O(n)__
