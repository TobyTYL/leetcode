# LC 1642. Furthest Building You Can Reach

## Description

You are given an integer array `heights` representing the heights of buildings, some `bricks`, and some `ladders`.

You start your journey from building `0` and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders.

While moving from building `i` to building `i+1` (`0-indexed`),

- If the current building's height is greater than or equal to the next building's height, you do not need a ladder or bricks.

- If the current building's height is less than the next building's height, you can either use one ladder or (h[i+1] - h[i]) bricks.

Return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally.

### Example 1:
<img src = "https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/27/q4.gif">

```
Input: heights = [4,2,7,6,9,14,12], bricks = 5, ladders = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Starting at building 0, you can follow these steps:
- Go to building 1 without using ladders nor bricks since 4 >= 2.
- Go to building 2 using 5 bricks. You must use either bricks or ladders because 2 < 7.
- Go to building 3 without using ladders nor bricks since 7 >= 6.
- Go to building 4 using your only ladder. You must use either bricks or ladders because 6 < 9.
It is impossible to go beyond building 4 because you do not have any more bricks or ladders.
```
## 思路
* 使用优先队列解决：
    * 从第一个建筑物开始，每次都计算当前建筑物和下一个建筑物的高度差，如果高度差大于 0，就将高度差加入到优先队列中。(最小堆)
    * 如果优先队列的大小大于梯子的数量，就将优先队列中的最小值弹出，并将砖块的数量减去当前堆顶元素，也就是最小值。因为这个时候我们必须要用砖块来填补这些差值。
    * 如果砖块的数量小等于 0，说明我们可以跳过去，不需要砖块或者梯子。
    * 如果遍历完所有建筑物，说明可以到达最后一个建筑物，返回最后一个建筑物的索引。

## Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def furthestBuilding(self, heights: List[int], bricks: int, ladders: int) -> int:
        # prepare: use a min heap to store each difference(climb) between two contiguous buildings
        # strategy: use the ladders for the longest climbs and the bricks for the shortest climbs
        min_heap = []
        n = len(heights)
        for i in range(n-1):
            climb = heights[i+1] - heights[i]
            if climb <= 0:
                continue
            if climb > 0:
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, climb)
            
            # 当我们已经记录的攀爬高度数量超过了可用的梯子数量。这意味着我们需要决定哪些高度差需要用砖块来填补，因为我们已经没有足够的梯子来处理所有的高度差。
            if len(min_heap) > ladders:
                # find the current shortest climb to use bricks
                brick_need = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
                bricks -= brick_need
    
            if bricks < 0:
                return i
        
        return n-1
