## 559. Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree

Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

Example 1:

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/narytreeexample.png" alt="My Image" height="250" />

```
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: 3
```

Ans:

```py
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=None, children=None):
        self.val = val
        self.children = children
"""

class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: 'Node') -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0

        from collections import deque
        count = 0
        q = deque([root])
        
        while q:
            # count += 1
            for _ in range(len(q)):
                
                cur = q.popleft()
                for child in cur.children:
                    q.append(child)
            count += 1
        
        return count
```
