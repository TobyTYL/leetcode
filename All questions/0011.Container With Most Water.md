# 11. Container With Most Water

## Discreption
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

### Example 1:

<img src = "https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg">

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

## Solution:

```py
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(height)-1
        max_v = 0
        while left <= right:
            width = right - left
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                value = height[left] * width
                left += 1
            else:
                value = height[right] * width
                right -= 1
                
            max_v = max(value, max_v)
        return max_v
```
