# LC 376. Wiggle Subsequence

Description:

A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.

For example, [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3) alternate between positive and negative.
In contrast, [1, 4, 7, 2, 5] and [1, 7, 4, 5, 5] are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.
A subsequence is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest wiggle subsequence of nums.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence with differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3).
```

Ans:

```py   
class Solution(object):
    def wiggleMaxLength(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        preC,curC,res = 0,0,1  #题目里nums长度大于等于1，当长度为1时，其实到不了for循环里去，所以不用考虑nums长度
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            curC = nums[i + 1] - nums[i]
            if curC * preC <= 0 and curC !=0:  #差值为0时，不算摆动
                res += 1
                preC = curC  #如果当前差值和上一个差值为一正一负时，才需要用当前差值替代上一个差值
        return res
```

```py
class Solution:
    def wiggleMaxLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0

        count = 1
        prev_status = None

        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            diff = nums[i] - nums[i - 1]
            if diff > 0 and prev_status != 'up':
                count += 1
                prev_status = 'up'
            elif diff < 0 and prev_status != 'down':
                count += 1
                prev_status = 'down'

        return count

```
