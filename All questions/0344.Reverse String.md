## LC 344. Reverse String 

Description: 

* 'Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

* You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:

```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

### __Ideal: Two pointers or change the order in s by using temp variable__

Ans:

```py
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        size = len(s)-1
        count = 0
        while count <= (size//2):
            temp = s[count]
            s[count] = s[size-count]
            s[size-count] = temp
            count+=1
        return s

```
