# LC 973. K Closest Points to Origin

## Description
We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the `K` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

(Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)

You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)

### Example 1:

```
nput: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
```

## Solution: Heap
```python
import heapq
class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        pq = []
        for x, y in points:
            dis = (abs(x) ** 2 + abs(y) ** 2) ** 0.5
            heapq.heappush(pq, (dis, x, y))
        res = []
        for i in range(k):
            a, b, c = heapq.heappop(pq)
            res.append([b, c])
        return res
```
