## Description
Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.

Example 1:

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 6
```

Ans:

```py
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def countNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        
        from collections import deque
        que = deque([root])
        count = 0
        while que:
            size = len(que)
    
            for i in range(size):
                cur = que.popleft()
                count += 1
                if cur.left:
                    que.append(cur.left)
                    
                if cur.right:
                    que.append(cur.right)
                    
        return count

```
