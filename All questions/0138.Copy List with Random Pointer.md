# LC 138 Copy List with Random Pointer

## Description
A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or null.

Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.

For example, if there are two nodes X and Y in the original list, where X.random --> Y, then for the corresponding two nodes x and y in the copied list, x.random --> y.

Return the head of the copied linked list.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:

val: an integer representing Node.val
random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) that the random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.
Your code will only be given the head of the original linked list.

### Example 1:

```
Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
```
## 思路
* 用一个字典先记录原始链表的节点
* 用一个指针p遍历链表，如果p不在字典中，就创建一个新的节点，然后把p加入字典
* 再次遍历链表，如果p.next存在，就把p.next指向的节点赋值给p.next
* 如果p.random存在，就把p.random指向的节点赋值给p.random

## Solution:
```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, x: int, next: 'Node' = None, random: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = int(x)
        self.next = next
        self.random = random
"""

class Solution:
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        original = {}
        p = head
        while p:
            if p not in original:
                original[p] = Node(p.val)
            p = p.next
        p = head
        while p:
            if p.next:
                original[p].next = original[p.next]
            if p.random:
                original[p].random = original[p.random]
            p = p.next
        return original.get(head)
```
