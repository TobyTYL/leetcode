# LC 39. Combination Sum

Description:

Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.

The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the 
frequency
 of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.

Example:
```
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
Explanation:
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.
```

## Ideal:

Ans:
```py
class Solution(object):
    def combinationSum(self, candidates, target):
        """
        :type candidates: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        path = []
        result = []
        def back_tracking(self, candidates, target, sum_v, start_index):
            if sum_v == target:
                # 因为是shallow copy，所以不能直接传入self.path
                result.append(path[:])
                return
            # 因为本题没有组合数量限制，所以只要元素总和大于target就算结束

            if sum_v > target:
                return
            # 单层递归逻辑 
            for i in range(start_index, len(candidates)):
                sum_v += candidates[i]
                path.append(candidates[i])
                # 注意递归逻辑，i递归之后还是加i
                back_tracking(self, candidates, target, sum_v, i)
                # 回溯
                sum_v -= candidates[i]
                path.pop()
        back_tracking(self, candidates, target, 0, 0)
        return result
```
