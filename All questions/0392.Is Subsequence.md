# Leetcode 392. Is Subsequence

## Description:
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

### Example 1:

```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

## Solution:
```py
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:

        s_ptr, t_ptr = 0, 0  # Pointers for s and t

        while t_ptr < len(t) and s_ptr < len(s):
            if s[s_ptr] == t[t_ptr]:
                s_ptr += 1
            t_ptr += 1

        return s_ptr == len(s)
```
