## Description
Given a binary array `nums`, return the maximum number of consecutive `1`'s in the array.

### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
```

## Solution:
    
```py
class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        max_v = 0
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == 0:
                count = 0
            else:
                count += 1
            max_v = max(max_v, count)
        return max_v
```
