# LC 1109. Corporate Flight Bookings

## Description
There are n flights that are labeled from 1 to n.

You are given an array of flight bookings bookings, where bookings[i] = [firsti, lasti, seatsi] represents a booking for flights firsti through lasti (inclusive) with seatsi seats reserved for each flight in the range.

Return an array answer of length n, where answer[i] is the total number of seats reserved for flight i.


## Example 1:

```
Input: bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,3,20],[2,5,25]], n = 5
Output: [10,55,45,25,25]
Explanation:
Flight labels:        1   2   3   4   5
Booking 1 reserved:  10  10
Booking 2 reserved:      20  20
Booking 3 reserved:      25  25  25  25
Total seats:         10  55  45  25  25
Hence, answer = [10,55,45,25,25]
```

## Solution:

```py
class Solution:
    def corpFlightBookings(self, bookings: List[List[int]], n: int) -> List[int]:
        nums = n * [0]
        df = self.Difference(nums)
        for booking in bookings:
            start = booking[0] - 1
            end = booking[1] - 1
            val = booking[2]
            df.addition(start, end, val)
        return df.result()
    class Difference:
        def __init__(self, nums):
            self.diff = len(nums) * [0]
            self.diff[0] = nums[0]
            for i in range(1, len(nums)):
                self.diff[i] = nums[i] - nums[i-1]
        def addition(self, start, end, val):
            self.diff[start] += val
            if end + 1 < len(self.diff):
                self.diff[end + 1] -= val
        def result(self):
            res = len(self.diff) * [0]
            res[0] = self.diff[0]
            for i in range(1, len(self.diff)):
                res[i] = res[i - 1] + self.diff[i]
            return res
