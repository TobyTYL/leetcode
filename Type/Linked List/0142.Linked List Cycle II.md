## LC 142 Linked List Cycle II

- [ ] Mark. Confused

Description: Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Do not modify the linked list.

Example:

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

Ideal: 
1. How to identify if there are a circuit in the linked list?
* Two pointers
  
    * fast pointer move 2 steps
    * slow pointer move 1 step
2. Find the entry position
* 从头结点出发一个指针，从相遇节点 也出发一个指针，这两个指针每次只走一个节点， 那么当这两个指针相遇的时候就是 环形入口的节点。
