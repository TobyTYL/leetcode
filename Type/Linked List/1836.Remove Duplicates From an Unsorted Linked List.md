# LC 1836. Remove Duplicates From an Unsorted Linked List

## Description

Given the head of a linked list, find all the values that appear more than once in the list and delete the nodes that have any of those values.

Return the linked list after the deletions.

### Example 1:
<img src = "https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/21/tmp-linked-list.jpg">

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,2]
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: 2 appears twice in the linked list, so all 2's should be deleted. After deleting all 2's, we are left with [1,3].
```

## 思路：
* 遍历链表，统计每个元素出现的次数
* 再次遍历链表，删除出现次数大于1的元素

## Solution: 

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicatesUnsorted(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        count = {}
        p = head
        while p:
            count[p.val] = count.get(p.val, 0) + 1
            p = p.next
        dummy = ListNode(-1)
        dummy.next = head
        p = dummy
        while p:
            unique = p.next
            while unique and count[unique.val] > 1:
                unique = unique.next
            p.next = unique
            p = p.next
        return dummy.next

# Time: O(n)
# Space: O(n)
```
