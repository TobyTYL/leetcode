# 143 Reorder List

## Description:
You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
Reorder the list to be on the following form:

L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

## Example 1:
<img src = "https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/04/reorder1linked-list.jpg">
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,4,2,3]
```

## Example 2:

<img src = "https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/09/reorder2-linked-list.jpg">

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,5,2,4,3]
```

## Solution
```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """
        # 先分成两半，左边的list不动，reverse右边的list
        slow, fast = head, head.next
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            # 当 fast 到达链表尾部时，slow刚好在链表中点。
            fast = fast.next.next
        # reverse右边的list
        # reverse second half
        second = slow.next
        prev = slow.next = None
        while second:
            tmp = second.next
            second.next = prev
            prev = second
            second = tmp
        # merge two halfs
        first, second = head, prev
        while second:
            tmp1, tmp2 = first.next, second.next
            first.next = second
            second.next = tmp1
            first, second = tmp1, tmp2
