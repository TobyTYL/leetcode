# LC 331. Verify Preorder Serialization of a Binary Tree

## Description
One way to serialize a binary tree is to use preorder traversal. When we encounter a non-null node, we record the node's value. If it is a null node, we record using a sentinel value such as '#'.

For example, the above binary tree can be serialized to the string "9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#", where '#' represents a null node.

Given a string of comma-separated values preorder, return true if it is a correct preorder traversal serialization of a binary tree.

It is guaranteed that each comma-separated value in the string must be either an integer or a character '#' representing null pointer.

You may assume that the input format is always valid.

For example, it could never contain two consecutive commas, such as "1,,3".
Note: You are not allowed to reconstruct the tree.

 
### Example 1:

```

Input: preorder = "9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#"
Output: true
```

## Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def isValidSerialization(self, preorder: str) -> bool:
        nodes = list(preorder.split(","))
        return self.deserialize(nodes) and len(nodes) == 0
    def deserialize(self, node):
        if not node:
            return False
        first = node.pop(0)
        if first == "#":
            return True
        return self.deserialize(node) and self.deserialize(node)
```
