# LC 387. First Unique Character in a String

## Description
Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.

 

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "leetcode"

Output: 0
```
Explanation:

The character 'l' at index 0 is the first character that does not occur at any other index.

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "loveleetcode"

Output: 2
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "aabb"

Output: -1
```

## Solution:
```py
class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s: str) -> int:
        hash_map = [0] * 26
        for i in s:
            hash_map[ord(i) - ord("a")] += 1
        ans = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            c = s[i]
            if hash_map[ord(c) - ord('a')] == 1:
                return i
        return -1
```
