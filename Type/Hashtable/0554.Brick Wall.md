# LC 554. Brick Wall

## Description
There is a rectangular brick wall in front of you with n rows of bricks. The ith row has some number of bricks each of the same height (i.e., one unit) but they can be of different widths. The total width of each row is the same.

Draw a vertical line from the top to the bottom and cross the least bricks. If your line goes through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not considered as crossed. You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will obviously cross no bricks.

Given the 2D array wall that contains the information about the wall, return the minimum number of crossed bricks after drawing such a vertical line.

### Example 1:

```
Input: wall = [[1,2,2,1],[3,1,2],[1,3,2],[2,4],[3,1,2],[1,3,1,1]]
Output: 2
```

## Solution:
```py
class Solution:
    def leastBricks(self, wall: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        size = len(wall)  # 墙的行数
        edges_count = {}  # 用于记录每个边缘出现的次数
        
        for row in wall:
            count = 0
            for brick in row[:-1]:  # 不考虑最后一个砖块的边缘
                count += brick 
                edges_count[count] = edges_count.get(count, 0) + 1  # 记录边缘次数

        # 找到穿过最多边缘的位置，边缘越多，穿过的砖块就越少
        max_edges = max(edges_count.values(), default=0)

        # 穿过的砖块数等于总行数减去最多边缘数
        return size - max_edges
```
