# LC 455. Assign Cookies

Description:


Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

Example 1:

```
Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
```

Ans:
    
```py
class Solution(object):
    def findContentChildren(self, g, s):
        """
        :type g: List[int]
        :type s: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        g.sort()
        s.sort()
        count = 0
        start = len(s) - 1
        for i in range(len(g)-1, -1, -1):
            # 位置调换，start >= 0在and前面，因为要判断是否为空
            # 先喂饱大胃口
            if start >= 0 and g[i] <= s[start]:
                start -= 1
                count += 1
        return count
```
