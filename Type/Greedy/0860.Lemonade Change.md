# LC 860. Lemonade Change

Description:

At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.

Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.

Given an integer array bills where bills[i] is the bill the ith customer pays, return true if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or false otherwise.


Example 1:

```
Input: bills = [5,5,5,10,20]
Output: true
Explanation: 
From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
Since all customers got correct change, we output true.
```

Ans:

```py
class Solution(object):
    def lemonadeChange(self, bills):
        """
        :type bills: List[int]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if bills[0] != 5:
            return False
        five, ten = 0, 0
        for bill in bills:
            if bill == 5:
                five += 1
            elif bill == 10:
                if five < 1: return False
                five -= 1
                ten += 1
            else:
                if ten > 0 and five > 0:
                    ten -= 1
                    five -= 1
                elif five > 2:
                    five -= 3
                else:
                    return False
        return True
```
