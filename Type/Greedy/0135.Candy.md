# 135. Candy

## Description:
There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

* Each child must have at least one candy.
* Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.


 Example 1:

```
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

## Solution:

```py
class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        candyVec = [1] * len(ratings)
        
        # 从前向后遍历，处理右侧比左侧评分高的情况
        for i in range(1, len(ratings)):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]:
                candyVec[i] = candyVec[i - 1] + 1
        
        # 从后向前遍历，处理左侧比右侧评分高的情况
        for i in range(len(ratings) - 2, -1, -1):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]:
                candyVec[i] = max(candyVec[i], candyVec[i + 1] + 1)
        
        # 统计结果
        result = sum(candyVec)
        return result
