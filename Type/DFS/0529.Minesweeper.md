# LC 529. Minesweeper

## Description
Let's play the minesweeper game (Wikipedia, online game)! You are given an `m x n` char matrix `board` representing the game board where:
* `'M'` represents an unrevealed mine,
* `'E'` represents an unrevealed empty square,
* `'B'` represents a revealed blank square that has no adjacent mines (i.e., above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals),
* digit (`'1'` to `'8'`) represents how many mines are adjacent to this revealed square, and
* `'X'` represents a revealed mine.

You are also given an integer array `click` where `click = [clickr, clickc]` represents the next click position among all the unrevealed squares (`'M'` or `'E'`).

Return the board after revealing this position according to the following rules:
* If a mine `'M'` is revealed, then the game is over. You should change it to `'X'`.
* If an empty square `'E'` with no adjacent mines is revealed, then change it to a revealed blank `'B'` and all of its adjacent unrevealed squares should be revealed recursively.
* If an empty square `'E'` with at least one adjacent mine is revealed, then change it to a digit (`'1'` to `'8'`) representing the number of adjacent mines.
* Return the board when no more squares will be revealed.

### Example 1:
<img src = "https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/08/09/untitled.jpeg">

```
Input: board = [["E","E","E","E","E"],["E","E","M","E","E"],["E","E","E","E","E"],["E","E","E","E","E"]], click = [3,0]
Output: [["B","1","E","1","B"],["B","1","M","1","B"],["B","1","1","1","B"],["B","B","B","B","B"]]
```

## 思路
* 有八个方向，分别是左上、上、右上、左、右、左下、下、右下
* 如果点击的位置是地雷，直接返回
* 如果点击的位置是空白单元格，递归地揭示周围的空白单元格
* 如果点击的位置是数字，显示周围地雷的数量
* 要count炸弹用辅助函数
* dfs显示空白单元格

## Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def updateBoard(self, board: List[List[str]], click: List[int]) -> List[List[str]]:
        if not board or not board[0]:
            return board
        rows, cols = len(board), len(board[0])

        directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), 
                        (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
        r, c = click  # 获取点击的位置
        if board[r][c] == 'M':
            board[r][c] = 'X'  # 点击的是地雷
            return board
        def count_mines(r, c):
            count = 0
            for dr, dc in directions:
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and board[nr][nc] == 'M':
                    count += 1
            return count
        def dfs(r, c):
            mine_count = count_mines(r, c)
            if mine_count > 0:
                board[r][c] = str(mine_count)  # 显示周围地雷的数量
                return
            
            board[r][c] = 'B'  # 揭示空白单元格
            for dr, dc in directions:
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and board[nr][nc] == 'E':
                    dfs(nr, nc) 

        dfs(r, c) 
        return board
```
