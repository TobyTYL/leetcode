# LC 684. Redundant Connection

## Description
In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

## Example 1:

```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
```

## Solution:
```py
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = [i for i in range(n)]

    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        px, py = self.find(x), self.find(y)
        if px == py:
            return False
        self.parent[py] = px
        return True

class Solution:
    def findRedundantConnection(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        uf = UnionFind(len(edges) + 1)
        for edge in edges:
            if not uf.union(edge[0], edge[1]):
                return edge
```
