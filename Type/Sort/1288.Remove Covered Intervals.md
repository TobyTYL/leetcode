# LC 1288. Remove Covered Intervals

## Description
Given a list of intervals, remove all intervals that are covered by another interval in the list. Interval `[a,b)` is covered by interval `[c,d)` if and only if `c <= a` and `b <= d`.

After doing so, return the number of remaining intervals.

### Example 1:

```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[3,6],[2,8]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Interval [3,6] is covered by [2,8], therefore it is removed.
```

## 思路：
* 排序，按照起始位置升序，假如start一样，按照结束位置降序
* 遍历，如果end大于prev_end，count+1，prev_end更新为end

## Solution:
```py
class Solution:
    def removeCoveredIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals = sorted(intervals, key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
        print(intervals)
        size = len(intervals)
        prev_end = 0
        count = 0
        for start, end in intervals:
            if end > prev_end:
                count += 1
                prev_end = end
        # print(len(intervals[:]))
        # print(intervals)
        return count
```
