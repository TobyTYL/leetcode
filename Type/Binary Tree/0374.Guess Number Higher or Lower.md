# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

## Description
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

* -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
* 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
* 0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).

Return the number that I picked.

## Solution: 
```py
# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if num is higher than the picked number
#          1 if num is lower than the picked number
#          otherwise return 0
# def guess(num: int) -> int:

class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        # binary search
        start = 1
        end = n
        while start <= end:
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            result = guess(mid)
            
            if result == 0:
                return mid
            elif result == -1:
                end = mid -1
            elif result == 1:
                start = mid + 1
```
