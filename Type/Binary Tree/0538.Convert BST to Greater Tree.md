## 538. Convert BST to Greater Tree

## Description:

Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.


## Example 1:

```
Input: root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]
```

## Solution

```py
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def convertBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        self.pre = 0  # 记录前一个节点的数值
        self.traversal(root)
        return root
        # 右中左
    def traversal(self, cur):
        if cur is None:
            return
        self.traversal(cur.right)
        cur.val += self.pre
        self.pre = cur.val
        self.traversal(cur.left)
        
```
