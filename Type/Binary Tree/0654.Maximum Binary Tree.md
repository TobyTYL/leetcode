## 654. Maximum Binary Tree

## Description
You are given an integer array nums with no duplicates. A maximum binary tree can be built recursively from nums using the following algorithm:

* Create a root node whose value is the maximum value in nums.
* Recursively build the left subtree on the subarray prefix to the left of the maximum value.
* Recursively build the right subtree on the subarray suffix to the right of the maximum value.

Return the maximum binary tree built from nums.
