# LC 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## Description
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

 

__Example 1:__

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

__Example 2:__
    
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

__Example 3:__

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

## Soluton:

```py
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        from collections import defaultdict
        need, window = defaultdict(int), defaultdict(int)
        left, right = 0, 0
        ans = 0

        while right < len(s):
            c = s[right]
            right += 1
            window[c] += 1

            # 说明窗口内有重复字符，需要缩小窗口，直到窗口内没有重复字符为止
            while window[c] > 1:
                d = s[left]
                left += 1
                window[d] -= 1
            # 在这里更新答案，因为这里是窗口内没有重复字符的时候
            ans = max(right - left, ans)


        return ans
```
